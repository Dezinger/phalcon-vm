<p>
	PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an object-relational database, with additional
	"object" features â€“ with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.
	As a database server, its primary function is to store data securely, and to allow
	for retrieval at the request of other software applications. It can handle workloads
	ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications
	with many concurrent users.
